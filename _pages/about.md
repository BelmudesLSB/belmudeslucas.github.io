### About Me
After working for great economic researchers and outstanding financial practitioners, I became thrilled by the power of Economics in Data Analysis and Decision-making. I am passionate about using quantitative analysis to understand more about fixed-income securities.

My interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance, with a strong passion for learning and discovering new computational techniques to apply in my research.
