# About Me:
After working for great economic researchers and outstanding financial practitioners, I became thrilled by the power of Economics in Data Analysis and Decision-making. I am passionate about using quantitative analysis to understand more about fixed-income securities.

My interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance, with a strong passion for learning and discovering new computational techniques to apply in my research.

[*Domestic vs. Foreign Law:
Portfolio Dynamics of Sovereign Debt*, with Angelo Mendes](assets/papers/domestic_vs_foreign.pdf)

_Abstract:_ The aftermath of sovereign default episodes for emerging and developed economies since the 1980s underscores the crucial role of
the legal jurisdiction under which debt is issued. This paper provides a quantitative framework for evaluating the trade‑offs between issuing
domestic and foreign‑law bonds from the sovereign’s perspective. While foreign‑law bonds offer stronger legal protections for investors and
thus command higher prices, domestic‑law bonds are more easily restructured after default. Using Cyprus as a case study, we first document
differences in the maturity structures of both types of debt. Then, we disentangle the effects of differences in maturities and recovery rates in
shaping the composition of the sovereign’s portfolio. The model reveals that when recovery rates are similar, the sovereign favors bonds with
shorter maturities. However, when recovery rates diverge, the sovereign prefers to issue the asset with a higher recovery rate. The dominant
factor hinges on the magnitude of recovery rate differences between foreign and domestic‑law debt after default.

[*Transparency in Debt Crisis*, with Angelo Mendes](assets/papers/transparency_in_debt_crisis.pdf)

_Abstract:_ We study the problem of a sovereign choosing whether to disclose information to international lenders in an Eaton and Gersovitz
(1981) environment. The government faces a trade‑off: full disclosure ensures that debt is sold at high prices in good times, but hampers new
debt issuance in bad times. Conversely, non‑disclosure creates an insurance opportunity through adverse selection. The unique equilibrium
under nodisclosure is a pooling equilibrium that allows the sovereign to take more debt in bad times at the cost of worse prices obtained in good
times. We characterize the sovereign’s optimal choice of information disclosure and show that non‑disclosure is preferred when deadweight
losses from defaulting are small. We argue that our model is consistent with the behavior of the Mexican government before and during the
1994‑1995 Mexican Crisis.

[*The Term Structure of Credit and Liquidity Risk Premia*, with Juan Passodore and Xu Yu]

_Abstract:_ We study the term structure of sovereign debt and default policies when credit and liquidity risk are jointly determined. To account
for both types of risks we focus on an economy with incomplete markets, limited commitment, and search frictions in the secondary market for
sovereign bonds.

[*COVID-19 Recession in Historical Perspective*, with Paulina Restrepo-Echavarría and Pablo Andrés Neumeyer](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/november/covid19-recession-historical-perspective)

_Abstract:_ We examined whether the COVID‑19 recession was one of the worst on record and whether this was a common feature across the
globe. To put the downturn in historical perspective, we compared forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2020 with the historical
record. For expected GDP growth, we relied on data from the October edition of the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook
(WEO), while historical data was sourced from the Maddison Project Database 2018.
